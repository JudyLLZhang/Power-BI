## **1. COVID-19 at 6 Counties in California**
   - We can use "Animated bar Chart Race" to design an dynamic bar chart with time. At this dashboard, I chose to use Scatterplot with 'Play Axis' to show the dynamic data.  
   - We can get the map with .JSON format at https://github.com/deldersveld/topojson/blob/master/countries/us-states/CA-06-california-counties.json

## **2. Actual vs Budget**
   - Created a calendar accroding the dataset.
   - Location format set as country for map.
   - :pushpin: Important! Sometimes we need to use different sheet from different countries, which has different express about data format. So we can use 'change type'->'using locale :pushpin:
