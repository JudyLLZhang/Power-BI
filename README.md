## **1. COVID-19 at 6 Counties in California**
   - We can use "Animated bar Chart Race" to design an dynamic bar chart with time. At this dashboard, I chose to use Scatterplot with 'Play Axis' to show the dynamic data.  
   - We can get the map with .JSON format at https://github.com/deldersveld/topojson/blob/master/countries/us-states/CA-06-california-counties.json
